This is my Summer Training Project in Java on Employee Management System Using Java Swings and SQLite Manager as the database at the backend.

### Basic Crud Functionality on Employees(Creating an Employee,Searching an Employee(Read),Updating an Employee and Deleting an Employee.

### Implemented on Netbeans to boost development workflow.

### This is a desktop application where only the admin is allowed to login.The admin can do all CRUD operations on the employee records like Creating an Employee,Saving the Employee,Updating an Employee,Deleting an Employee.

### The admin is the only authorised user and only he has the access to the system and manages the entire records of the respective company.

###  Using the Print Functionality, a list of all employees can printed as well as it can be saved as a pdf as well.Along With that
the BLOB image of the employee will be fetched from the database where it is stored.

### I have tried to minimise the frames as much as possible so as to give a user-friendly experience to the admin of a company who wants to manage the employee records.
